There is an instruction in the OpenZFS documentation:

https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/Debian/Debian%20Buster%20Root%20on%20ZFS.html

The steps looks scriptable. We can use user-data to deliver script to cloud
instance, so manual steps would be made minimal. However, Hetzner-provided
installation ISO does not contain live environment and I could not follow the
instruction. FIXME.
